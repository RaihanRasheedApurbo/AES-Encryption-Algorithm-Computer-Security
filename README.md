This is a assignment that perform AES encryption system with 128byte key or 16 charecter key. 

solution.py holds the whole implementations. To perform Galois Field multipication we have used bitvector library. How to use this libray is demonstarted in bitvector_demo.py 

Assignment description simulation and overview file is also avaialbe that helps would help someone to understand basic theory and implementation method of AES algorithm.

input can be taken using console or text file and both of this situation can be created using runScript.sh



we have 3 branch here.... 
master branch holds the final refactored bug free implementation

refactor-previous-submission branch was marged with master. before that master had bug. So refactor-previous-submission and master now have same code.

things-i-do-for-love has another interesting experimental implementation without any padding information but it also seems to work.
